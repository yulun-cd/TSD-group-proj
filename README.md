# Data pre-processing for exploring regional variation of knife-related offences in England and Wales

The file `workbook.ipynb` contains the whole process of getting the geometry data for UK regions and PFAs boundaries, combining it with 
the knife-related offences data and exporting the results as shapefiles that are ready for use in Tableau.

The four `.png` files are the final results from Tableau. They are not directly produced by this notebook.

The file `kc_regional_variation.xlsx` contains knife-related offences data for different regions and PFAs in the UK.
